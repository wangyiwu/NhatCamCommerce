Version specific steps:
In 4.60, we have moved customer related fields from the "GenericAttribute" table to the "Customer" table (see details in https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce/issues/4601). 
If your database has a lot of "Customer" records, auto migration (during the first application start) can take a long time, so we have prepared scripts to update the database. Execute customer_data_migrate.sql (depending on the db provider) script over your database.
